# DND5E Scriptlets
This module provides a few QOL features for dnd5e that don't really fit anywhere else.

## Clean Rolls
When enabled the roll formulas with "+ +" "+ -" should be converted to a single "+" or "-". Requires libwrapper.

## Ammunition Selector.
When enabled, any time a weapon with ammo is used a dialog appears prompting you to choose the ammunition to use. If there is no suitable ammunition the weapon roll is blocked. This version does not require midi-qol, just dnd5e. Enabling is a client setting so each player can choose to enable it. Thanks @Lukas and @Krigsmaskine

## Lukas' Character Sheet Filter
This provides a filter field on character sheets to filter (by name) items/spells/features. Thanks @Lukas

## Lukas' Fade Unprepared Spells
Spells that are not prpepared are faded out on display. Thanks @Lukas

## Lukas' Item rarity colors.
Color item inventory lines according to the item's rarity. Thanks @Lukas

## Auto Item Rechage
When enabled at the start of an actors turn items with a recharge will have their recahrge rolled.

## Legendary Recharge
When enabled legendary actions will be reset at the start of the actors turn.

## Token Resizer
When enabled adds a resizer icon to the token controls sidebar to allow setting selected tokens size. 

## Roll Unlinked Toeken HP
When enabled an unlinked token dropped to the canvas will have it's Hp auto rolled.

## Alternate Advantage
Allows you to specify a roll formula to add/subtract to a roll for advantage/disadvantage instead of rolling 2 dice.  
The roll is evaluated against the actor/items roll data so expressions like "1d4 + @abilities.str.mod" will work, or just a number like 2

## Ammunition Recovery
Simple ammo recovery - for a more complete solution use the excellent Ammo Recovery module.
Auto executed at end of combat.  
Can be called per actor with globalThis.dnd5eScriptlets.restoreAmmoActor(actor), or globalThis.dnd5eScriptlets.restoreAmmoActors().   
Magical ammunition is not recovered but the amount consumed is recorded and displayed. Magical ammo must have the magic property set recovery to be disabled.  

## Silent Initiative
Support silent initiative rolls - if enabled initiative rolls are not reported to the chat log.

## Update Created Actors effect origins.
When creating/importing an actor the origins of the effects may be incorrect. This feature attempts to correct them.

## Item Drag Drop.
When dragging an item from an actor or world container you can specify to delete the item on the completion of the drop. Configurable in settings.

## Enable token dynamic ring
Enable token dynamic ring when creating a token. Allows you to set a default ring whenever a token is created. Can also specify ring and background color.

Scriptlets uses icons from the excellent dfreds-convenient-effects which
